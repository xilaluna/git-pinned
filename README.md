# git-pinned

A simple go scraper that gets all of your pinned repos on GitHub via an API endpoint.

## 🧑‍💻 How to Use

The most basic route defaults to my account and gets my pinned repos. Feel free to change this in the `main.go` file.

```
api/
```

The next api route allows you to enter your username after the slash and fetch the pinned repos for that specific user.

```
api/:username
```
